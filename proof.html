I edit myself on my phone by drawing over the bits of my body I wish would disappear.
The fat around my hips.

The loose skin that drips off my upper arms.

The fat that swells around my cheeks, the stuff that makes me feel like a weasing, slobbering pug.

I could get plastic surgery.

A friend of mine, twenty-two, has started to get botox.

### "It's $500, but it lasts for four to six months. And I don't smoke weed anymore."

I draw a dent under my ribs.

How I hate this snippet writing.

The writing that snips.

That truncates.

That wavers, uncertain, in the space.

Is it potent? Or is it just short? 
Cemented with meaning only because of the cold line breaks that surround its quivering heart.

Ahh, the phyiscal thiness of writing. 


I want my words to be 

//skinny//.


All I want is for you to


# // take me seriously //.


Whenever I turn my head, my back cracks.

I crack my fingers.

I keep editing.

I draw a thick white rectangle between my thighs.

I already have a thigh gap, but it's not big enough.

And it's too-- //wavy//--//organic//.

I want a thigh gap because there's no longer any muscle on my thighs.

I want long, emaciated bones.

Sometimes, I'll grab my arse, my thighs, the fat pockets and the cellulite and I will tell myself,

//disgusting//--

and I will imagine it all disappearing slowly, the hunger chewing it away like weevils.

But even the bones of my hips are too wide.

The fat has slowly rolled off, but the bones that poke out are all wrong.

They're still //so broad//.



                       



# I //said//, I want to //disappear//.


When I edit, I narrow my hips down.
I narrow them down past the bone. I know I will never look that way, no matter how much I don't eat. 

My body here is triangular, masculine.

The body I've seen in the media.

The body that from the nineties to the naughties was commemorated.



//"We only put bodies like that on the runway, because they need to be walking coathangers."//

Now I know why I hate the natural curves of my body.

I want to be metal.
Wire thin.
Bendable.
Expendable.
A rake.
A coathanger.
A doorknob.
An oyster.


Thank God for Kim K. Thank God for cottage cheese bums and hour glass figures and Brazilian Butt Lifts and the slimy, sadistic shift from a society that celebrated starving women who took up no space with their frames to a society that heralds women who artificially enhance the sexualised aspects of their already objectified form.

* lips

* tits

* arses

* toes

oh
just you?



//But doesn't it all come down to choice ?//

Yeah, like when I was seven all I could imagine was myself at twenty-two with an eating disorder, dedicating my life to being:

Emaciated. 

Thin. 


I stop to survey my work.

I've turned myself into a skeleton.

I watch, let my body with its thick, white halo shift and blur into one big mussel.

I'm perfect.

At least if I looked like this, I ruminate, I'd no longer have to contend with the societal standard. People would finally cease seeing me as a body. I could finally escape it all.

'//Cush the Clam//', they'd call me.
I'd be a superhero. Superhuman. Inhuman. Transhuman. Posthuman.

I put my phone down,
turn my head,
crack my back,
lay my pro-crustacean bed

He asked if I wanted dinner. 
I sat on the tram, in the rain, with a wet umbrella by my leg and the smell of wet dog on my collar and I messaged back, “Already had dinner, but always down for snacks.”
When I arrived he had seaweed crackers and hummus.
I ate two crackers with hummus and four glasses of rich red wine and sat outside and inhaled his dart smoke and mocked his insecurities and then we sat on the couch and then we took off our jackets and then we went into his room and that’s when I turned into an oyster for the first memorable time in my life.
After he finished, he went to wash his hands and he said as he left, “Don’t worry, I’m not done—” And I must have frowned or something because I was pretty certain he was done and then he said, “With you, yet.” 
And my stomach sank, big fat white pearl, down into my hips and all I could smell was salt. Sweet, white salt. 
When he came back in, he pulled me down and I pretended like I was enjoying it and I held his head and [[that felt nice-&gt;reproductive organ part 2]] and that felt powerful and then I finally asked him to stop because I couldn’t be bothered anymore and I interlaced my legs with his and pretended to understand intimacy, but I didn’t and I don’t, not that soon into relationships anyway, and finally I asked, “Would you be offended if I went home?” and he asked if I wanted to have a shower with him first and I should of, because I had cum in my hair, but I hadn’t known about that at the time, so I said no, and I got dressed, found my socks, didn’t forget my jacket, didn’t forget my phone, kissed him on the mouth, left, said ‘adios’ with my umbrella up, and went and sat on the tram, in the rain, with a wet umbrella by my leg and the smell of sex and wet dog on my collar and I messaged five of my oldest friends and hated myself. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Gills" tags="" position="339,296" size="100,100">

I couldn’t help it.

Every time I slipped into myself, 

Realised I was alone,

I felt this overwhelming sense of fear,

That maybe I was going to slip away,

That I would just disappear,

And no one would even miss me.





(align:"&lt;==")+(box:"=XXXXX====")[I took jungle juice in the bathroom]




Suddenly my features swelled and shrunk until all I saw was a misshapen lump in the mirror, with red plugs for eyes and a swollen, unshapely mouth that seemed to outgrow the rest of my head.

I’d never seen myself like that before.

I ran back to the crowd and hugged myself onto [[Bella-&gt;Bella]], terrified that if I let go, that misshapen lump would grow back and I would cease to exist. 
All that would be left, like the mirror reflected, was that bad, unsightly, thing. 



After everyone left, I sat in the bath and crawled into my knees, hugging my body so tight my fingers left white streaks along my swollen calves. // A limpet, a limpet, a limpet. // I let my skin crack off and splinter and stick to the bathtub sides like one long, mutated crustacean.

The pale yellow tub seemed oppressive. 
I shivered in the heat and ran my tongue along the ulcers in my mouth, tried to find the [[missing words-&gt;Mouth]] that were hiding in my teeth.


This morning I woke up, my lips huge and bill-like. I’d chewed them until they had swelled. 

My face still seems more ovular than before, my skin grey and warped.
I touch the edges and it feels hard, like cracked brick.
I tell myself this is the shift I want. 
I no longer want weak limbs and rubbery skin that cuts and bruises and rolls. // A limpet, a limpet, a limpet.//

I close my eyes and when I open them, I stop to admire my new shell.

I'm back by the sea.


I see a multitude of selves whenever I come back here, and [[the fragments-&gt;Lacan]], instead of merging neatly, clump gracelessly against one another, like some hastely strewn collage-- and I feel dim witted and slow that I'm unable to put myself together in a coherent way.


As I stood in the shower I noticed the mole that sits above my bottom left rib has swollen and grown into a slightly misshapen lump.

I wonder if all things I let near my heart become cancerous and sore.


After four weeks of full time work, my skin has broken out disgustingly.

Buried beneath a dirty mask, black heads have begun to show.

I buy a cranberry face mask that promises to exfoliate and cleanse my pores deeply.

As it dries, the pink fades to red and when I wash it off in the shower, it comes off like blood in my hands.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Abductor" tags="" position="376,537" size="100,100">When I first started walking, I grew blisters on my feet. 
They groaned and swelled and ribboned into fat red roses and my feet are scarred still, on the joints of my toes, on the backs of my heels. 
For two weeks I had a cushiony blood blister beneath the pad of my left toes. 
I slobbered and cried when they hurt too much to walk. 
Not because of that pain, which felt minimal in comparison to the pain I felt in my chest, but because I wasn’t able to exercise.
I wore socks and sandals to work and didn’t eat so that I wouldn’t lose progress and my feet would heal faster.
When the blisters finally healed, I walked with relish, and for the rest of the weeks in summer, I wore two pairs of socks to soak up the sweat and bought baby powder for my feet so that it would never happen again.
Instead, I ripped apart my hip flexors with my anguish. 
I walked and walked and walked and the little muscles that connected my legs to my torso screamed in their tautness and I’d squish my fingers in the groove to try and quell their shrieks. 
I took up yoga again, to try and stretch them out. Ahh yes, the mind, body connection.
I expected myself to feel weaker, because I’d stopped fuelling my body.
My limbs, though tight, were lighter.
The adrenaline that rises in your bloodstream from fasting, and the energy of caffeine, allowed me to attempt poses with ease.
I could hold a plank for two minutes before I’d get bored and collapse.
I have been told the mind gives up faster than the body does.
I stretched myself out; my favourite was extended mountain pose, I’d shoot my limbs up and rocket myself skyward and [[admire my ribs in the mirror. The hollow concave of my stomach.-&gt;Cooper]] I’d roll my feet against the ground and feel so centred, so present, so //here.//
And then I’d swing my arms down, collapse back into reality.
I read a memo in my phone from this time period.

//I’m not sure if I’ve grown, or if I just stand up taller because I take up less space now anyway.//

Beneath that I’d written,

//I just want to walk it all away. The fat, the guilt, the shame, the embarrassment and emerge as a skeleton of myself. 
Emerge purely as me--
Like a blank slate, not this thing that has life and trauma and hardship stuck as fat pockets around its legs and hips.//

I walk less rigorously now. 
But to this day, my hip flexors still hurt. 
They groan and complain and mutter under their breaths about the audacity I have to push them apart so often.

‘Now just to get abs’. He said.

I watched as he let air back into his now-relaxed diaphragm, the point of his ribs that seemed so much like long peninsulas, slowly submerging back beneath his muscles as if the tide had finally pushed its way back in.

He was all little orange suns

The outer edge of the pool was plastic and white. 
It was surrounded by rubbery orange turf and it smelt like summer, always.
We’d done a couple of laps, before I distinctly remember slipping, and the weightlessness of falling.
Then I was at the bottom of the pool, under the water, looking up.

I wasn't aware I couldn’t breathe.

I was so calm. Relaxed.

Maybe I was too young to fully understand the immense seriousness of my situation. Maybe I was shocked by the cold water.

But there I was, sank to the bottom, considering what to do next, when I heard my brother say, “Grab my foot!”

So I did, his big black laced sneaker, and I was rudely sucked out, back into this dry world, where everyone fussed and fretted and patted me down.



To this day, when I swim, I tickle my neck with my fat fingers as if checking for a chain, or a bite, or to reassure myself with the firm touch of my collarbones, when in actual fact, I’m just waiting for my gills to reappear.
